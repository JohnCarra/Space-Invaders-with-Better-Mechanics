# Space-Invaders-with-Better-Mechanics  
This is a project by a CSUF student team that aims to create an improved version of the classic arcade game, Space Invaders. The game is built using the Python programming language and the Pygame library.

## Features  
This version of Space Invaders includes several new features that make the game more challenging and engaging for players. Some of the new features include:  

More types of enemy ships with unique behaviors and abilities  

More weapons and power-ups for the player to use  

Improved graphics and sound effects  

Boss fights at the end of each level

## Getting Started

To play Space Invaders with Better Mechanics, you will need to have Python and Pygame installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and Pygame can be installed using pip.

Once you have Python and Pygame installed, you can download the source code from the project's GitHub repository (https://github.com/JohnCarra/Space-Invaders-with-Better-Mechanics) and run the game using the following command:
python space_invaders.py

## How to Play

The objective of Space Invaders is to destroy all of the enemy ships before they reach the bottom of the screen. The player controls a ship that can move left and right, and fire lasers to destroy the enemy ships.

The player can collect power-ups that provide additional weapons and abilities, such as a shield that protects the player's ship from damage.

The game consists of several levels, each with its own unique boss fight at the end. The player must defeat the boss to progress to the next level.
